Title: Drift Across-Batches Normalization and Visualization
Description: This package contains several functions applicable in a large-scale metabolom analysis as well as other high throughput experiments. Notably, it includes distinct functions for preprocessing of data and estimation of missing values, conventional functions for batch effect correction based on statistical models, as well as functions using advanced statistical tools to generate several diagnosis plots to inform users about their data structure. Several statistical models are included in the 'dbnorm' such as two-stage procedure model (see 'ber' , a package in R ) or empirical Bayes methods in two setting of parametric and non-parametric (see 'dbnorm', a package in Bioconductor ), in order to give users the flexibility to choose one of those models which better fits to their data. By including advanced statistical tools, the 'dbnorm' package allows user to inspect the structure and quality of multidimensional datasets both in macroscopic and microscopic scales, at the level of sample sets and metabolic features respectively.
