*dbnorm* contains R functions which allow visualization and 
removal of technical heterogeneity from large metabolomics dataset. By including advanced statistical tools, the *dbnorm* package allows user to inspect the structure and quality of large metabolomics datasets both in macroscopic and microscopic scales at the sample batch level and metabolic feature level, respectively.
It allows users to efficiently correct drift across batch and to adjust large metabolomics datasets for technical variation which helps improving the estimation of the biological mechanisms underlying disease condition or medical state.
*dbnorm* includes 11 distinct functions for pre-processing of data and estimation of missing values, 
conventional functions for batch effect correction based on statistical models, as well as functions using advanced statistical 
tools to generate several diagnosis plots to help users to choose the statistical model which better fits to their data 
structure. *dbnorm* includes several statistical models such as, ComBat(parametric and non-parametric)-model [PMID:16632515]  from sva package [PMID:22257669] ,that was already in use for metabolomics data normalization, and ber function [DOI:10.1007/s12561-013-9081-1], priorly developed for microarray gene expression data, that we propose here as a new approach for correction of drift across batch in metabolomics datasets.

## Instructions
In this section, we briefly introduce and explain the functions implemented in the *dbnorm* with the expected outcome. Data to be uploaded must be normalized and scaled on the log2 to account for the high abundance features (variables) by which technical heterogeneity might be overlooked. The input data must be in csv format with the independent experiments in the rows and the features (variables) in the columns, with the `batch` levels considered in the first column.

##### *Upload your data ana call the package;*

- Example:

> data<-read.csv(" path/to/directory/folde/mydata.csv",sep = ",", header = T, row.names = 1)

> library(dbnorm)

### Functions

> - emvd

This function allows you to estimate missing values (Zero or/and NA values) by the lowest detected value in the entire experiment.

```
df<-data[-1] #keep data matrix by removing batch level in the first column
>emvd [df]
f<- emvd[df] # save the imputed data matrix
```
> - emvf

This function allows you to estimate missing values (Zero or/and NA values) for each feature (variable) by the lowest value detected for the corresponding feature (variable), applied on the column. 

```
df<-data[-1] #keep data matrix by removing batch level in the first column
> emvf [df]
f <- emvf[df] # save the imputed data matrix
```
> - Visdbnorm ; 
*Visualization of drift across batch normalization*

This function performs batch effect adjustment via three statistical models implemented in the *dbnorm*, namely two-stage procedure as described by Giordan (2013)[DOI:10.1007/s12561-013-9081-1] and/or empirical Bayes methods in two setting of parametric and non-parametric as described by Johnson et al.(2007) [PMID: 16632515] and in sva package by Leek et al.(2012)[PMID: 22257669]. Meanwhile, the graphical inferences in the context of unsupervised learning algorithms create visual inspection to inform users about the spatial separation of the sample sets analyzed in the different analytical runs alongside the distribution of features (variables) in the raw and treated datasets. This function is suggested for less than 2000 features (variables).

- Value

Graphical check such as *PCA* plot and *Scree* plot compiled into a **PDF** and three **csv** files for adjusted data based on the models implemented in the package.The *RLA* plots are visualized in the **Viewer** panel in the **rstudio** console. 
```
ff<- data.frame(data[1],f]# frame the batch level with imputed matrix
Visdbnorm(ff)
```
> - ACDdbnorm ; 
*Adjusted coefficient of determination for a data normalized for across batch signal drift*

This function gives a quick notification about the performance of the statistical models, two-stage procedure [DOI:10.1007/s12561-013-9081-1] and/or empirical Bayes methods in two setting of parametric and non-parametric as described in [PMID: 16632515] and by sva package [PMID:22257669], implemented in the dbnorm package, in accommodating technical variability. Subsequently, the  adjusted coefficient of determination or Adjusted R-Squared is calculated for each variable estimated in a regression model for its dependency to the batch level in the raw data and treated data via either of those models. Immediately, the performance of applied models are presented by a score calculated based on the maximum variability explained by the batch level, notify the consistency of model performance for all detected features (variables), facilitating quick comparison of the models for selecting one of those models, which is more appropriate to the data structure. This function is suggested for less than 2000 features (variables) for better computational speed.

- Value

Graphical check such as *Correlation* plot and *Score* plot compiled into a **PDF** file and the two vector data matrix of Adjusted R-squared for each model and a *Table* of score for the maximum Adjusted R-squared detected for the applied models in the **csv** file.

```
ff<- data.frame(data[1],f]# frame the batch level with imputed matrix
ACDdbnorm(ff)
```

> - profplotber
> - profplotpcomr 
> - profplotnpcomr

> *Visualization of analytical heterogeneity on the profile of features (variables)
in raw, ber- parametric ComBat and non-parametric ComBat corrected data*

These functions allow users to adjust the data for batch effect using either of models implemented in the package described earlier, and inform about the presence of across batch signal drift or batch effect in the raw and treated data represented via the shifted probability density function (PDF) plots of the features (variables) detected in an experiment.

Graphical check such as *PDF* plots compiled into a **PDF** file and a **csv** file of corrected dataset via either of applied function.

> *Data normalization for across batches signal drift using either of  ber-, parametric ComBat- and non parametric ComBat- models and unsupervised clustering and regression analysis of corrected data*

These functions allow users to adjust the data for across batch signal drift or batch effect using of either of those models implemented in the package described earlier. These functions include advanced statistical tools to inspect the structure and quality of high throughput experiment, both in macroscopic and microscopic scale at the sample batch level and metabolic feature level, respectively. Notably, using these functions users perform unsupervised clustering analysis of the raw data and the treated dataset. In parallel, Adjusted-R squared value for each feature (variable) estimated by regression model is calculated, which demonstrate the dependency of feature (variable) to the batch level in either of those datasets. In addition, for quick notification about the performance of the applied model we considered a score, which is calculated based on the maximum variability. This score notifies the performance consistency of an applied model on the detected features (variables).

- Value

Graphical check such as *PCA* plot, *Scree* plot and *Correlation* plot compiled into a **PDF** and the **csv** for corrected dataset based on either of applied model and the two column matrix of Adjusted-R squared. The *RLA* plots are visualized in the **Viewer** panel in the **rstudio** console.
