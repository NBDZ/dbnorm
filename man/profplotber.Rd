\title{Profile Plot of Features (variables) in ber- corrected data}
\usage{
profplotber(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A data frame in which rows define the independent experiments (samples) and columns the features (variables), with the batch in the first column.}
}
\value{
Original and adjusted datasets in \bold{csv} format together with the series of profile plot for the variables( features) in the sample sets analyzed in the entire experiment provided by the \emph{Scatter} plot,\emph{Violin} plot and \emph{pdf} plot compiled into \bold{PDF} file.
}
\description{
It is a function in the \code{dbnorm}, a package in R. This function allows you to adjust the data for batch effect using two-stage procedure approach ( see also "ber" function and its package in R ) and informs you about the presence of batch effect or changes in the profile of detected features (variables) in the corrected data, determined by the shifted probability density function plots (\emph{pdf} plots).\cr
}
\details{
Zero and NA values are not allowed. Optionally missing value can be imputed by the functions such as \code{emvf} and/ or \code{emvd} implemented in the \code{dbnorm}. Input must be normalized and transformed prior.

\examples{
\dontrun{
batch<- rep(gl(5,10,labels = c(1:5),1))
y<- matrix(rnorm(5000),nrow=50)
m<-data.frame(batch,y)
profplotber(m)
