\title{Adjusted Coefficient Of Determination for a data normalized for signal drift across batches\cr}
\usage{
ACDdbnorm(m)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A data frame in which rows define the independent experiments (samples) and columns the features (variables), with the batch levels in the first column.}
}
\value{
Several graphs compiled into a \bold{PDF} file which are a \emph{correlation} plot for each of applied models, a grouped \emph{barplot} presenting the maximum variability associated with batch levels in the raw and the corrected datasets.\cr
Files saved as \bold{csv} in the working directory are a dataset corrected via either of applied models. Also, a two column matrix for Adjusted R-Square for raw and corrected datasets and a table summarizing the score values presented in \emph{barplot}.
}
\description{
It is a function in \code{dbnorm}, a package in R. This function gives a quick notification about the performance of the compiled statistical models namely two-stage regression procedure (see "ber" function and its package in R) and/or empirical Bayes methods in two setting of parametric and non-parametric ( see "ComBat" in "sva", a package in bioconductor), on accommodation of batch effect. Using this function users will estimate values of adjusted coefficient of determination ( Adjusted R- Squared ) which address the dependency of each feature (variable) to the batch order in each dataset. Immediately, a score calculated based on the maximum variability estimated by the regression analysis has been calculated and printed. This score notifies the consistency of a model performance for the detected features (variables), facilitating quick comparison of the models for selecting one of those models, which is more appropriate to the data structure.\cr

\details{
Zero and NA values are not allowed. Optionally missing value can be imputed by \code{emvf} or \code{emvd}, functions implemented in \code{dbnorm} package. Input data must be normalized prior.
